# New package: pkgdiff

# Goals:
# 1. Stability rating.
# 2. Breaking changes report for entire repository/list of packages.
# 3. Drill-down reports on packages with breaking changes.
# 4. Ease portability with compatible versions instead of exact versions.
# 5. Scan code for known breaking changes.
# 6. Minimum compatible version or compatible version vector.
# 7. Scan for minimum compatible version.

# Upgrade list
pkgs <- c("common", "fmtr", "logr", "reporter", "libr")

# Get installed versions
res3 <- get_installed_packages(pkgs)

res3

# Get latest versions
res4 <- get_latest_data(pkgs)

res4

# Get Upgrade Report
res4 <- report_breakages(res3, res4)

res4

# To do: Stability score
res5 <- report_stability(pkgs)

res5

# See stability over time
res1 <- get_stability_score("fmtr")

res1


# To do: Code scan
# res5 <- scan_code(res4)

# To do: Create badge for stability score

# To do: Create website to publish package stability ratings
